# todoApp

I have used PyCharm IDE for this project.

1. Download the project from GIT.
    - https://github.com/sk1619/todoApp.git
    
2. Create a virtual environment for python3.x and activate it
      
   - source envTodo/bin/activate

3. Install packages directly from requirements.txt
    - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
4. Install sqlite3 (If not installed)

5. DB dump is also attached inside this project (todoDB.sql) 

6. Run the shell scripts in terminal (There are total of 4 scripts)
    - ./script_API_GET.sh 
    
    All scripts contain hard-coded value. Please go through the scripts before running, it may return some error code if data is not prresent in database.
